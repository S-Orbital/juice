**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like Duck Life: Adventure meets Duck Live but with a 2D RPG-like adventure."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
It's based on various accuracy mechanics for combat, where you can learn new abilities and use different weapons; along with promoting your character to be able to fight stronger enemies. Some mechanics include specific clicking techniques to make the game take rhythm almost, and to have a pixilated art to make the game fun. Each weapon is like it's own minigame. Each weapon has it's own technique, which makes it unlike most fighting games which have relatively simple combat techniques. Unlike video games that are based on randomness, this game is based on raw skill and mastery of the different combat techinques. You will also fight enemies who have combat techinques based on calculations.
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Players face different enemies with storylines and stuff, and are able to trade with & take on quests from NPCs; along with fight in dungeons to grind out resources and EXP, and do intense parkour in different areas to obtain specific items or just move around the world. The rewards are either better weapons, player leveling, some resources/currency, skills, or achievements/titles. You can also increase your rank as a player by leveling up enough, and their is a whole ranking system for players going from S, A, B, C, D, to E. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
The enemies they fight get exponentially harder, and the parkour and combat skill require between enemies increases. It also gets exponentially harder to level up your character, and a lot of fights will take multiple, and even enemies have different combat techniques. All players originally start at E-rank, and get different buffs in the community for reaching different ranks. The game is going to be a large closed-2D world, with a lot of mechanics that aren't usually considered in 2D RPGs.
